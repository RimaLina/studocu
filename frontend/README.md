# Quality Assurance engineer test
Welcome to the QA Engineer tech test. We expect the work to take around 1 to 1.5 hours, and we thank
you in advance for taking that time for us!

This test consists of two parts: a written part and a coding part. For the written part, we would
like to receive a PDF, slide presentation or preferably an MD file (readme) with your insights. For the coding part, a fork of this repo with
your solution will do.

### Automated Testing Assignment


You can clone this repo (with ```--bare``` and push the solution with ```--mirror```  to a new repo in your account) and run:

```
$ python -m http.server 8000
```

You now have a working frontend app that you will write some kind of automated user acceptence tests for.

Your choice for language and framework are up to you, however we would prefer JS, TS or PY and possible the Playwright framework, given we use these internally.
